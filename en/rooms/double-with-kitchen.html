  <p>
 The room has a double bed, a TV and a kitchenette with a stove, fridge and kettle. It is not a problem to place a 3rd bed or cot in the room.
  </p>
  <p>
  Just outside the door is a sitting area overlooking the garden. Ideal for a family with a child.
 </p>
 <p>The room is "almost" barrier-free (1 step from the parking lot, 1 step to the garden, a gentle hill and 1 step to the room).</p>

      <p>We have departures at 10:30 and arrivals at 12:00. If you need to leave later, but guests arrive at your room, you can store your luggage in the facilities of the guest house. We try to accommodate our guests, so arrivals and departures are set very close to each other. If more than one room leaves at the same time, it is not possible to prepare all rooms for 12. It is ideal to state the approximate time of your arrival in the reservation so that everything is ready in time and especially with sufficient cleaning, without which we simply will not let you into the room. Before your room is ready, you can sit in our garden or breakfast room.</p>
