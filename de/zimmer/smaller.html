<p> The smallest room of our guest house overlooking the garden. We use it as a single (especially in low season) or as a double room for a short vacation.</p>
<p>This room is also popular for longer stays, as an economical option.</p>
  <p>
     It is possible to have a TV in the room.

      <p>We have departures at 10:30 and arrivals at 12:00. If you need to leave later, but guests arrive at your room, you can store your luggage in the facilities of the guest house. We try to accommodate our guests, so arrivals and departures are set very close to each other. If more than one room leaves at the same time, it is not possible to prepare all rooms for 12. It is ideal to state the approximate time of your arrival in the reservation so that everything is ready in time and especially with sufficient cleaning, without which we simply will not let you into the room. Before your room is ready, you can sit in our garden or breakfast room.</p>
