   An ideal choice for a family of four. Two separate rooms and two bathrooms.
   </p> <p>
    After opening the front door of the apartment, you enter a small hallway with a refrigerator. On the left is the entrance to the first bathroom and on the right to the first room. The opposite door leads to the second room, which has a second bathroom. If you use the apartment when traveling with friends, it is necessary to take into account that one of the couples will go to the bathroom through the hallway. Not common for the whole pension, but for your two rooms.

  It is possible to have a TV in the room. Both rooms and one bathroom have a direct view of the town of Český Krumlov. </p>  <section class="section">

      <p>We have departures at 10:30 and arrivals at 12:00. If you need to leave later, but guests arrive at your room, you can store your luggage in the facilities of the guest house. We try to accommodate our guests, so arrivals and departures are set very close to each other. If more than one room leaves at the same time, it is not possible to prepare all rooms for 12. It is ideal to state the approximate time of your arrival in the reservation so that everything is ready in time and especially with sufficient cleaning, without which we simply will not let you into the room. Before your room is ready, you can sit in our garden or breakfast room.</p>
