      <p>Welcome to the website of Pension Gerta in Český Krumlov</p>
      <p>
   We are a small family-run guest house with a history dating back to 1992. It all started by renting two rooms with a shared bathroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the course of 30 years, we have rebuilt the guest house several times according to the wishes of our guests. We are record holders in remodeling bathrooms.

  Everyone has different ideas about ideal accommodation. We try to make everyone's holiday as pleasant as possible. Gerta Talířová, a mother, usually takes care of our guests herself. Do you have anything on your mind? Let us know! This is the only way we can solve it so that your holiday does not have a mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
    We look forward to your visit. Our goal is returning guests for a long time.

    <div class="section__left align-start">
      <p>
       Our Pension Gerta is located in a quiet part of Cesky Krumlov with beautiful surroundings. The location of the pension is ideal. You are protected from city noise, but the center is a few minutes' walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to the accommodation in the center you can park directly in front of the house and behind the window you have our fabulous view of the castle.
      </p>

        You can spend your free time in the city, by the pool, at the end of the street by the Hornobránský pond (swimming pool and playground) or you can walk to Křížová hora, which you have nearby.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a great starting point for your rides. The surroundings of Český Krumlov are beautiful and you can be inspired on the page with
